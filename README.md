# Common Algorithms Repository

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of commonly used algorithms implemented in Python, C++, and Rust. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about algorithms or an experienced developer seeking reference implementations, this repository serves as a valuable resource.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of various algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- And many more...

Each algorithm is implemented in three different programming languages:

- **Python**: Known for its simplicity and readability, Python implementations offer clarity and ease of understanding.
- **C++**: Renowned for its efficiency and performance, C++ implementations are ideal for high-performance computing.
- **Rust**: Recognized for its safety and concurrency features, Rust implementations combine performance with memory safety.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on algorithm categories. Within each category, you'll find subdirectories for each algorithm. Each algorithm directory contains implementations in Python, C++, and Rust, along with relevant documentation and test cases.
